//!
//! Canon - The standard of correctness for Vize.
//! TypeScript type checker for Vue.js Single File Components.
//!
//! ## Name Origin
//!
//! **Canon** (/ˈkænən/) in art refers to a set of ideal proportions or standards
//! that define perfection. Just as classical sculptors followed canons to
//! achieve harmonious proportions, `vize_canon` enforces type correctness
//! as the standard for Vue SFC code.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! This crate is currently a work in progress (WIP).
