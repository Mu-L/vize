# Davinci completion metrics — review input

Snapshot: 2026-09-26. Repository inventory base:
[`aac2e1bf8bf2796870ac5145067a981e6cacf588`](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/tree/aac2e1bf8bf2796870ac5145067a981e6cacf588).
Measurements below name their own revisions; they do not describe an unselected
release candidate. P6-10 remains open: its P5-14 start gate and the finished-substrate
review have not passed. This is the collected input to that review.

## Target authority

[Charter #35](./README.md#decided-positions) requires improved compile throughput
and peak memory, halved keystroke-to-diagnostics p95, fact adoption beyond the
neutral-core majority, source maps on every backend, and matrices without orphans.
[Budgets](./plan/budgets.toml) own the pinned measurements and ratchets.
A passing regression ceiling alone does not establish an improvement target.
Unrecorded measurements remain unrecorded; no target is changed here.

## Reconciliation

| Metric                             | Pinned target or baseline                                                                                                                   | Recorded achievement and scope                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Review status / blocker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

## R1 — Production LSP resource measurement

The successful [TS-44 job 108388832282](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36236392245/job/108388832282)
ran at measurement head
`e1bee278790a2d78742d21f5000fb8c3b3932131`, containing the production
resident implementation revision `56a65d3d314975ea29aa66f4f0f8cd942d67b8d0`. It used the existing
`linux-x64-ci` preset, three fresh `ci-opt` servers, twenty edits each and
a sixty-second idle window. Server, Corsa and tsgo RSS were sampled together
every 50 ms. The workload is the nine-file TS-45 `real-vue` fixture.

| Metric                    |    Result | Unchanged ceiling |
| ------------------------- | --------: | ----------------: |
| Cold start, median        |    4.9 ms |              9 ms |
| First diagnostics, median | 1118.0 ms |           1398 ms |
| Keystroke p95             |   31.1 ms |             46 ms |
| Peak process-tree RSS     | 288.8 MiB |           337 MiB |
| Idle process-tree RSS     | 276.6 MiB |           316 MiB |
| Idle CPU, maximum         |     0.15% |                1% |
| Server binary size        |  46.7 MiB |            59 MiB |

[Committed raw samples](./plan/completion-metrics/r1-resource-linux-x64-ci.json)
preserve the measurement after artifact expiry. Their source is the
[`resource-linux-x64-ci` artifact](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36236392245/artifacts/10903579774)
(artifact ID `10903579774`). The original method and baseline
remain in [P5-11a](./plan/phase-5-records/p5-11a.md).

The same workflow's
[synthetic resident job](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36236392245/job/108388832528)
passed its 10k-input probe. Its
[`resident-resource-linux-x64-ci` artifact](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36236392245/artifacts/10903969071)
is separate evidence: fixture alpha inputs, isolated resident database, ten-second
idle, no LSP/Corsa. See [P5-4b progress](./plan/phase-5-records/p5-4b-progress.md).

The strict all-provider job in that run did not complete; see [R3](#r3--production-scale-observations).
No wider workload may borrow the nine-file ceiling or establish the
largest-project/halving acceptance.

## R2 — Production source-snapshot refresh

After immutable source-world snapshots and editor overlays landed on the
production branch, the same nine-file preset passed again in
[job 108398702457](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36240038670/job/108398702457).
Measurement SHA: `a4e59f078ce1bb42d27681938bc591bce3b12e24`;
producer SHA: `049358b200baa82d99b04c40f95aa68d0e8fae7c`.
The required nine-file, synthetic resident and bounded production jobs all
succeeded in this workflow. Its
[artifact 10905303903](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36240038670/artifacts/10905303903)
is preserved as [retained samples](./plan/completion-metrics/r2-resource-linux-x64-ci.json)
without replacing R1's history.

| Metric                    |    Result | Unchanged ceiling |
| ------------------------- | --------: | ----------------: |
| Cold start, median        |    5.2 ms |              9 ms |
| First diagnostics, median | 1116.9 ms |           1398 ms |
| Keystroke p95             |   29.3 ms |             46 ms |
| Peak process-tree RSS     | 290.5 MiB |           337 MiB |
| Idle process-tree RSS     | 281.2 MiB |           316 MiB |
| Idle CPU, maximum         |    0.167% |                1% |
| Server binary size        |  47.0 MiB |            59 MiB |

The 15.05 ms halving target remains unmet. This refresh does not establish a
large-project or completed-substrate improvement claim.

## R3 — Production scale observations

The [corrected production job 108398702433](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36240038670/job/108398702433)
passed at resource SHA `a4e59f078ce1bb42d27681938bc591bce3b12e24`,
producer SHA `049358b200baa82d99b04c40f95aa68d0e8fae7c`.
[Artifact 10905478324](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36240038670/artifacts/10905478324)
contains the full observation and the separate two-file edit oracle.

This one session opens 10,000 SFCs and checks document-symbol residency for every
file, but warms only **16 distinct alpha providers**. Its 32 body edits and
public-interface oracle run on a two-file prelude. It records 1120.8 MiB peak RSS,
1039.5 MiB final RSS after ten seconds without keyboard input, and 143.835% summed
process-tree CPU during that window, over an 83.569-second session. Summed CPU can
exceed 100% because the process tree uses multiple cores. Background work is still
active; keyboard inactivity does not establish settled idle. This bounded
observation is record-only, not full 10k alpha coverage or P5-11b acceptance.

The corrected sampler retains observed PID/birth-time CPU counters through exit.
The earlier sampler lost retiring Corsa processes' counters; its 53.879% is an
uncorrected historical sample, excluded from current reconciliation. No numeric
ceiling is invented for this broader workload.

The prior [strict all-provider job](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36236392245/job/108388832165)
was cancelled after approximately sixty minutes. Its last checkpoint reached
2,304 of 10,000 open and metadata-warmed files at 7138.5 MiB. There is no completed
peak/idle artifact for that scope. Full provider warming and background resource
behavior remain concrete scale blockers. [Resource PR #6807](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/pull/6807)
owns the [detailed production record](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/blob/1fc3a8685c1dcfe3e00448b2ed2fd22a0953aa25/docs/davinci/plan/phase-5-records/p5-4b-production-lsp-resources.md)
and [full corrected JSON](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/blob/1fc3a8685c1dcfe3e00448b2ed2fd22a0953aa25/docs/davinci/plan/phase-5-records/p5-4b-production-lsp-resources.json).

The later frozen producer `ad5c60f710547d3f6431d9a12224616316b4449b` is measured
separately in [run 36240385542](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36240385542).
Its result was pending at this snapshot; the completed 049 measurements above
are exact history and cannot be transferred to that newer head.

## Review still required

- P5-14 must pass before the P6-10 finished-substrate review.
- Record comparable compile and large-project resource results, explaining each
  miss without changing the targets.
- Reconcile fact consumption with the historical adoption definition and current
  rule identities; preserve explicit gates for intentional non-consumers.
- Refresh source-map and matrix evidence at the final candidate SHA.
- Record the maintainer's review separately. No reviewer acceptance or v1 decision
  is recorded by this input package.

The [v1 evidence package](../release/davinci-v1-evidence.md) maps these inputs to
the release checklist and preserves its remaining blockers.
