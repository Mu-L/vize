# Davinci v1 alpha evidence package — review input

Snapshot: 2026-09-26; inventory base
[`aac2e1bf8bf2796870ac5145067a981e6cacf588`](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/tree/aac2e1bf8bf2796870ac5145067a981e6cacf588).
No v1 alpha candidate SHA or version has been selected. Every checklist item below
has evidence or a named blocker. P6-11 remains open until P6-10 completes and the
maintainer accepts this package. The go/no-go decision and surface sign-offs remain
the owners' decisions; this document records none.

## Evidence index

### Pending runtime integration

[PR #6801](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/pull/6801), at
`e1d0f5dffaa55861015694d10512b338435b31af`, assembles computed DOM names,
computed model arguments, Suspense and computed outlet props. Its
[Lean run 36238077438](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/actions/runs/36238077438)
and broad checks were pending when this input was assembled. Individual feature
proofs are not substituted for terminal checks on that combined head or for a
merged release candidate. The parent integration [PR #6789](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/vize/pull/6789)
also remains subject to its latest exact-head CI and merge-queue validation.

## Phase exit blockers

The phase files own the normative gate lines. This package keeps their boxes open.

| [P6-13](../davinci/plan/phase-6.md#exit-gate-machine-checkable) | Depends on P5 exit. Full TS-48..51, ExprRef report, SDK GA, metrics review, external reviewers and maintainer-only communications decision remain open.                                                             |

## Checklist evidence map

These row IDs are linked from [the normative checklist](./v1-alpha-go-no-go.md).
“Candidate pending” means a v1 alpha version and exact target SHA must first be
selected through the existing release PR workflow. Prior release evidence cannot
be promoted to that SHA. Commands and gate strength in the checklist are unchanged.

### Pre-tag gate

| PT-3 | No blocking draft, P0/P1 request or failing workflow                        | **Blocked.** Open phase exits and SDK/resident acceptance above require triage. Release captain must review current issue/PR state and latest required workflow heads before promotion.                    |

### Release PR and promotion gate

| ID   | Checklist item                                        | Evidence / blocker                                                                                                                                        |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RP-1 | Authenticated release command                         | **Candidate pending.** Authorized release captain runs `vp run release alpha -y`; [workflow procedure](./pr-workflow.md).                                 |
| RP-2 | Release PR author has maintain/admin role             | **Candidate pending.** Record the actual release PR and its author permission result; no author is assumed.                                               |
| RP-3 | Exact-head checks and Release candidate ready         | **Candidate pending.** Require terminal successful candidate readiness and all required checks on that release PR head.                                   |
| RP-4 | Latest main before promotion                          | **Candidate pending.** Preserve refreshed-head validation if main advances; candidate script owns this check.                                             |
| RP-5 | Atomic main / merge / tag identity                    | **Candidate pending.** Read back the identical validated commit for main, release PR merge and alpha tag; no manual release-tag shortcut.                 |
| RP-6 | Original Release run publishes prevalidated artifacts | **Candidate pending.** Record the original [Release run](../../.github/workflows/release.yml), promotion result and reused candidate artifact provenance. |

### Publish gate

| ID   | Checklist item                                                     | Evidence / blocker                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PU-1 | CLI, GitHub Release, native/root/WASM npm, crates.io, VS Code jobs | **Candidate pending.** Require every listed publisher and exact-version visibility check; success of one registry is insufficient.                                                              |
| PU-2 | Optional Open VSX channel                                          | **No owner dispatch recorded.** [Open VSX workflow](../../.github/workflows/release-open-vsx.yml) remains optional and requires the editor owner's explicit dispatch after a published release. |
| PU-3 | npm version and prerelease dist-tags                               | **Candidate pending.** Read exact published versions and dist-tags for every release package, including the four packages named in the checklist.                                               |
| PU-4 | Every published Rust crate visible                                 | **Candidate pending.** Use the exact crate inventory in [publish_crates](../../tools/moon/cmd/publish_crates/main.mbt), including Canon and Patina, then read each registry version back.       |
| PU-5 | VS Code new pre-release visible                                    | **Candidate pending.** Editor owner supplies marketplace exact-version readback.                                                                                                                |
| PU-6 | Release notes / assets / prerelease flag                           | **Candidate pending.** Release captain reads GitHub release metadata and every expected artifact/checksum. Historical v0.428.1 is a stable release, not alpha evidence.                         |

### Post-publish gate

| ID   | Checklist item                                                    | Evidence / blocker                                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PP-1 | Fresh install from external directory                             | **Candidate pending.** Run checklist alpha CLI/Vite/Vite Musea installs in a throwaway directory after registry visibility; preserve installed versions.        |
| PP-2 | Docs site / search index / release post                           | **Candidate pending.** Docs owner reads deployed site after [Deploy Docs](../../.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml), matching the released main revision.        |
| PP-3 | Native optional dependencies on macOS/Linux/Windows               | **Candidate pending.** Record actual tarball install/runtime results on all three operating systems.                                                            |
| PP-4 | Release communication: version, install, limits, rollback/support | **Maintainer scope decision pending (P6-12).** Prepare truth-pass evidence; do not infer permission to publish or a support window.                             |
| PP-5 | Production readiness status                                       | **Candidate pending.** Reconcile every changed claim with [Production Readiness](./production-readiness.md), required evidence and known experimental surfaces. |

### Rollback plan

Rollback rows are preparedness items, not instructions to perform destructive
actions before a failure. No rollback or registry mutation is requested here.

| ID   | Checklist item                    | Evidence / blocker                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RB-1 | Restore prior alpha npm dist-tags | [Checklist procedure](./v1-alpha-go-no-go.md#rollback-plan). **Candidate pending:** release captain must identify the prior verified alpha version before promotion.         |
| RB-2 | Deprecate a bad npm version       | [Checklist command](./v1-alpha-go-no-go.md#rollback-plan). **Conditional:** npm owner supplies affected/fixed versions and an actionable message if an incident requires it. |
| RB-3 | Yank bad Rust versions            | [Checklist command](./v1-alpha-go-no-go.md#rollback-plan). **Conditional:** Rust owner determines affected exact versions and need for containment.                          |
| RB-4 | Repair GitHub assets              | [Checklist procedure](./v1-alpha-go-no-go.md#rollback-plan). **Conditional:** release captain identifies only the affected assets and validated fixed tag.                   |
| RB-5 | Revert/redeploy wrong docs        | [Deploy workflow](../../.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml). **Candidate pending:** docs owner records the last verified Pages artifact/revision.                             |
| RB-6 | Fixed VS Code pre-release         | [Editor recovery procedure](./v1-alpha-go-no-go.md#partial-editor-publication-recovery). **Conditional:** editor owner and release captain retain control over unpublishing. |

Partial publication recovery remains the exact registry-identity/readback procedure
in [trusted publishing recovery](./trusted-publishing-recovery.md) and the
[editor recovery section](./v1-alpha-go-no-go.md#partial-editor-publication-recovery).
Rerun failed jobs in the original Release run; preserve tag identity and verify
every expected destination before declaring publication complete.

### Communication

| ID   | Checklist item                      | Evidence / blocker                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CO-1 | Tracking status comment/discussion  | **Maintainer decision pending.** This package is review input; release captain owns the final go/no-go/rollback status and its publication.                                       |
| CO-2 | Owner verification / workflow links | **Owner sign-offs pending.** Each owner must name themselves, exact candidate/run and their verified section. This document supplies inputs and cannot substitute for acceptance. |
| CO-3 | Incident impact / versions / action | **Conditional:** if rollback occurs, incident owner records user impact and the affected/fixed versions before closure; no incident is asserted here.                             |

## Acceptance handoff

P6-10 review is blocked by P5-14 and the metric misses above. P6-11's evidence
assembly is reviewable now; the task remains unticked until its dependency and
maintainer acceptance are recorded. P6-9 external builders/reviewers and P6-12
communications decisions must come from the named humans. Refresh all candidate
rows and preserve raw artifacts before requesting the final release decision.
